## What and why

<!-- One to three sentences: what this changes and why. The diff shows how. Link issues: "closes #123", "refs #456". -->

## Requirements and decisions

<!--
The requirement IDs (R-…), assumptions (A…), predecessor bugs (F…), supply-chain measures (S-…), open points (O-…) and ADRs this change implements, changes or relies on.
A change that contradicts a requirement or an accepted ADR needs @greluc's approval first: link it here.

Be concrete: which tests, on which OS (Windows, Linux), which corpus evaluation, which app launch and what you saw.
If something could not be tested, say so explicitly. "Tests pass" is not a description.

## Checklist

### Every pull request

- [ ] Every commit carries a `Signed-off-by:` trailer that matches its author (DCO 1.1, `git commit -s`). A GitHub noreply address is fine if the commit author uses the same address.
- [ ] I have signed the [CLA](https://github.com/greluc/uex-datarunner-client/blob/main/CLA.md): my GitHub handle is in [`docs/cla-signatures.md`](https://github.com/greluc/uex-datarunner-client/blob/main/docs/cla-signatures.md), or this pull request is my `cla: sign — <handle>` signature and quotes the acceptance sentence of CLA §11 verbatim in its description.
- [ ] Every commit message and the pull-request title follow Conventional Commits (`<type>(<scope>): <summary>`).
- [ ] The documents this change affects are updated in the same commit as the change, not in a follow-up commit or pull request; contradictions I noticed are fixed or reported. A user-visible change also updates `README.md`, the user guide and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- [ ] Every shipped component or bundled asset this pull request adds or changes has its `NOTICE` entry, and every bundled file (OCR model, font, icon, logo) also has its `REUSE.toml` annotation, its licence text under `LICENSES/` and its SHA-256 in `NOTICE`. Its licence is allowed by the "Stack rules" in `CLAUDE.md`.
- [ ] The Star Citizen Fan Kit unit is untouched: the logo file, the Fan Kit Guidelines section 2b trademark line and the Fankit Agreement clause 2(g) notice are unchanged byte for byte, still rendered together and in English in every locale, and the tests that pin them are unchanged. A deliberate change has @greluc's approval and is named under "Reviewer notes".
- [ ] AI involvement is disclosed with `Co-Authored-By:` trailers that name the tool and model.
- [ ] No requirement, assumption, open point or other ID is reused or renumbered; a dropped requirement is marked `Withdrawn`.
- [ ] Unverified statements are marked as assumptions; versions, API fields and licences name their source.
- [ ] No secrets (UEX secret key, app token), personal data, private or unredacted screenshots, or large binary files in the diff.
- [ ] Everything is written in English with British spelling; verbatim third-party text is unchanged.

### Code (if affected)

- [ ] `./gradlew check` passes for every commit, because merges keep every commit (no squash merges); CI is green on Windows and Linux.
- [ ] Core modules: the test came first (red, green, refactor); a new use case has an acceptance test tagged with its requirement ID; a bug fix starts with a reproducing test.
- [ ] Domain terms follow the ubiquitous language (11 §A1); aggregate invariants are covered by tests.
- [ ] The code sits in the right module and package; no new module dependency outside the context map (02 §2); no technology types cross a module boundary.
- [ ] No new ArchUnit, Error Prone or NullAway finding; a suppression has its row in the suppression register (09 §3a) and its reason in the commit message and this pull request.
- [ ] No comments besides Javadoc, also none in configuration files; Javadoc describes the actual contract.
- [ ] No magic numbers, boolean control parameters, `null` returns or swallowed exceptions; error cases and cancellation are handled and tested.

### Recognition (if affected)

- [ ] Corpus evaluation run (R-QA-3): no regression in a `gated` class and no new silently wrong field in any class. The result is attached or summarised below.
- [ ] A change to locate, anchors or crop geometry: I looked at the crop dumps of the whole corpus.
- [ ] No absolute pixel or RGB thresholds (R-OCR-17, R-OCR-18).
- [ ] No `expected.json` was regenerated from a recognition run; `verified` was set only by a human who checked the values.
- [ ] A model or runtime change updates the OCR digest deliberately (R-QA-4); revision and SHA-256 of every OCR asset are recorded in its checksum file and in `NOTICE` (S-22).

### UEX API (if affected)

- [ ] New or changed fields, endpoints or error codes were verified against the live API, with `is_production=0` for anything that writes, and `docs/plan/06-uex-api.md` is updated.
- [ ] Test responses are written against the documented schema; recorded responses are committed only anonymised and only once UEX allows it (06 open point 7).
- [ ] Only resolved IDs from the UEX vocabulary reach the API, never free OCR strings.

### UI (if affected)

- [ ] All texts come from ResourceBundles; colours only from CSS theme variables.
- [ ] Deviations from the UEX value are shown with colour, icon and text (R-UI-10 to R-UI-12).
- [ ] I launched the app and saw the change working.
- [ ] The upload screenshot still never contains the balance (test).

### Privacy and network (if affected)

- [ ] No new network destination and no new kind of data sent to an existing one; otherwise @greluc approved it and 02 §9 is updated.
- [ ] Secrets never reach logs or the diagnostics export (R-NF-4, R-NF-6); images go to the AI recognition only as panel crops (02 §9).

### Dependencies (if affected)

- [ ] Every new dependency is justified under "Dependencies and keys": purpose, SPDX licence ID and its source, maintenance status (S-29).
- [ ] Changelog of the update read; new transitive dependencies checked in the lockfile diff (S-9).
- [ ] Lockfiles and `gradle/verification-metadata.xml` are updated in this pull request as a separate commit (S-3, S-5); new signing-key fingerprints and the source they were checked against are listed under "Dependencies and keys".
- [ ] Repositories, versions and licences follow the "Stack rules" and supply-chain rules in `CLAUDE.md` (S-1, S-2); any exception is recorded in 10 and named below.

### Build and CI (if affected)

- [ ] GitHub Actions are pinned by full commit SHA without a trailing comment, and `docs/dependency-pins.md` records the tag each SHA resolves to.
- [ ] Workflow `permissions` are minimal.
- [ ] Every `gradle/actions` step sets `cache-provider: basic` or `cache-disabled: true`.
- [ ] A CI tool a workflow downloads is pinned by version and SHA-256, or installed from a hash-locked requirements file (S-36), and has its row in `docs/dependency-pins.md`.

## Dependencies and keys (if affected)

<!-- Per new or updated dependency: name, version, purpose, SPDX licence ID and where you read it, maintenance status. Per new signing key: fingerprint and the page you checked it against. Otherwise "None". -->

## Upgrade notes (if affected)

<!-- Database or config schema change and its migration (R-NF-11), changed setting defaults, anything a user has to do after updating. Otherwise "None". -->

## Reviewer notes

<!-- What needs a close look, which trade-offs were made on purpose, and what is deliberately left for a follow-up (link the issue). -->
