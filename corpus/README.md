# OCR Test Corpus

This directory contains the **public** part of the golden corpus (see `docs/plan/07-ocr-concept.md` §4). The private part lives outside the repo and is included via `TALLYLINE_CORPUS_DIR`.

## Rules

- The balance ("CURRENT BALANCE") is **always redacted** before an image ends up here. No player names, no chat windows.
- Each entry has a directory `<location>-<nr>/` with the images and `expected.json`.
- `expected.json` stays at `"verified": false` until a human has independently checked the transcription. Unverified entries count in the eval only as "smoke", not as a golden metric. Unverified entries and entries with `gameVersion: null` never validate a game version for a layout profile (R-OCR-19).
- **Original screenshots** (lossless, original resolution) are preferred. Images uploaded via chat are probably scaled and recompressed; this is noted in `source` (schema version 2: `sourceFidelity`).
- An entry with `sourceFidelity: reencoded-unknown` (assumption A6, e.g. `pyro-gateway-stanton-01`) never counts for a resolution or capture-method class. It counts only for its theme and text-height band and as a source for synthetic variants.
- **Real class captures go into the public corpus by default**, after redaction, so that CI can gate their classes. A capture is added only if the contributor took it themselves or the person who captured it consented, and the contributor agrees to its publication in `corpus/public/` ([CLA](../CLA.md) §6, [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)). The private corpus holds only captures that cannot be redacted without destroying the evaluated region. A class that exists only privately has the status `insufficient` in CI and is evaluated locally before every release (`docs/release-process.md`).
- **Redaction** uses filled rectangles over the balance and personal data (player names, chat, and the `Session:` line of the `r_DisplayInfo` debug overlay when it is on) only. It must not touch the shop panel, the location field or the anchors, and it must not re-encode the rest of the image. PNG originals stay PNG. JPEG originals are redacted with a block-level lossless wipe (e.g. `jpegtran -wipe`); if that is not possible, they are decoded once and stored as PNG, and `sourceFidelity` records it.
- **Schema version 2** of `expected.json` (07 §4) adds per-capture `conditions` (capture method, HDR, renderer, resolutions, …) and a `measured` object, and moves the section to the card (`sectionHeaders` per capture; `section` and, for partial cards, `partialEdge` per card). Unknown values are `null`, never guessed. `pyro-gateway-stanton-01` is migrated in M2 with unknown values set to `null`.
- Schema version 2 entries also carry the expected UEX IDs (`expectedTerminalId`, `expectedCommodityId`), capture times (`capturedAt`) and a frozen `reference/` directory of recorded, anonymised UEX responses (07 §4). Without them an entry counts only as smoke for prior-dependent metrics. Whether UEX data may be published here is open (06 open point 7); until it is cleared, `reference/` directories live in the private corpus under the same entry id.
- **"Report a misread" exports** (R-QA-5) become a new entry only if the contributor allows it in the misread form, under the same consent rule. They contain redacted panel crops, not full frames, so, like `reencoded-unknown` entries, they count only for their theme and text-height band, never for a resolution or capture-method class. The exported values stay `"verified": false` until a maintainer has checked them. The exported reference snapshot goes into the entry's `reference/` directory with `priorProvenance`, in the private corpus until 06 open point 7 is cleared.
- Corpus data outside the Git repository (the private corpus under `TALLYLINE_CORPUS_DIR`) has a `SHA256SUMS` file per entry; the eval verifies it before running.
- **Images are stored in Git LFS** (decided 2026-10-14, O-43): `.gitattributes` routes every `.jpg`, `.jpeg` and `.png` under `corpus/public/` through LFS, so Git holds only pointer files with the SHA-256 of each image. Contributors need `git-lfs` installed before they clone or add images. A clone without LFS objects has pointer files in place of the images; the corpus runner refuses such a file with a visible error and never reports it as passed. CI jobs that read the images check out with LFS and cache the objects; other jobs do not fetch them. CI never fetches unpinned corpus data.

## Licence

The images in `corpus/public/` are screenshots of Star Citizen. The game content they show is copyright Cloud Imperium Rights LLC and Cloud Imperium Rights Ltd. They are **not** covered by the project licence (GPL-3.0-or-later): [`REUSE.toml`](../REUSE.toml) marks them `LicenseRef-Game-Screenshots` ([`LICENSES/LicenseRef-Game-Screenshots.txt`](../LICENSES/LicenseRef-Game-Screenshots.txt)), and [`NOTICE`](../NOTICE) §3 lists them. They are here only as test data for the text recognition; this project grants no rights in them, and any use of the game content is subject to Cloud Imperium's terms. Whether those terms allow the screenshots in a public repository is not verified yet: the project owner checks the RSI Terms of Service and the Fankit and Fandom FAQ (O-28 in [`docs/adr/0000-open-points.md`](../docs/adr/0000-open-points.md)). If they do not, the images are removed.

- The transcriptions (`expected.json`) and every other text file here are under the project licence, GPL-3.0-or-later.
- The images are never shipped in the installers or app archives. They are part of the repository as Git LFS objects (the repository uses no `export-ignore`). GitHub's source archive of a tag holds only their pointer files: the repository setting "Include Git LFS objects in archives" stays off (O-43). To get the images, clone the repository with `git-lfs`.
- Recorded UEX data (`reference/` directories, the reference snapshot of a misread export) gets its own licence marking only once UEX allows publishing it ([06](../docs/plan/06-uex-api.md) open point 7); until then it stays in the private corpus.
- The `REUSE.toml` patterns cover `.jpg`, `.jpeg` and `.png` files under `corpus/public/`; an image in any other format needs a new pattern in the same pull request.

## Entries

| Entry | Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `pyro-gateway-stanton-01` | Pyro Gateway (Stanton), blue theme: 4× Buy (scrolled, without overlap), 1× Sell | transcribed, not verified |
| `patch-city-01` | Patch City (Pyro), orange theme, 3840×2160 originals, debug overlay on, no location text: 1× Buy, 10× Sell (scrolled with overlap) | transcribed, not verified (schema version 2) |
| `ruin-station-01` | Ruin Station (Pyro), orange theme, 3840×2160 originals, debug overlay on: 5× Buy, 22× Sell (scrolled with overlap; Pitambu never complete) | transcribed, not verified (schema version 2) |

| `seraphim-station-01` | Seraphim Station (Stanton), blue theme, 3840×2160 originals: the same pages without a selected inventory (`unselected-*`, 5× Buy, 7× Sell, debug overlay on) and with Seraphim Station selected (7× Buy, 7× Sell) | transcribed, not verified (schema version 2) |
| `levski-01` | Levski (Nyx), grey theme, 3840×2160 originals from three positions: front (`v1-*`), closer front (`v2-*`) and oblique (`v3-*`), each 5× Buy and 22 to 26× Sell | transcribed, not verified (schema version 2) |

The originals of `patch-city-01`, `ruin-station-01`, `seraphim-station-01` and `levski-01` and the game's language file `global.ini` in use when they were taken belong in the private corpus; each `expected.json` records their SHA-256.
