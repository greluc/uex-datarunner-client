# System architecture

> **Doc type:** Living spec — binding. Last reviewed: 2026-10-14.

> Amended 2026-10-12 (ADR-0005): the implementation language is Rust with egui, native code only by registered exception. The context cut, the ports, the data flow and all behavioural rules of this document are unchanged; §2, §3, §4a, §4b, §7, §8, §9 (wording) and §10 name the Rust technology instead of Java, JavaFX and Gradle. Crates, versions and tools not named in ADR-0005 are chosen and verified at source in M0.

Guiding principles:

1. **UEX data is a constraint, not decoration.** Every recognition is resolved against the closed vocabulary (terminals, commodities, status levels, container sizes). Free OCR strings never reach the API.
2. **Guess nothing silently.** Every uncertainty becomes visible as a warning with a reason code. The submission gate blocks anything unresolved.
3. **Pure domain logic and I/O are separated.** Pipeline stages are pure functions on immutable records. This makes them testable with golden data, without UI and without network.
4. **Language-neutral cut.** The module boundaries allow individual parts (e.g. the OCR core) to be replaced later.

## 2. Modules (Cargo workspace, one crate per context) – bounded contexts + ports & adapters

The cut combines **DDD bounded contexts** with **ports & adapters** (decision and trade-offs: [ADR-0002](../adr/0002-modules-by-bounded-context.md), technology terms amended by [ADR-0005](../adr/0005-rust-and-egui.md)). Below, "module" means a Cargo workspace crate:

- **Core** = one crate per bounded context ([11 §A2](11-ddd-and-tdd.md)), plus `shared-kernel` and `workflows`.
  - Each context crate contains its domain model **and** its application services (use cases).
  - The core knows no technology: no egui, no image codecs, no HTTP or sockets, no SQL, no ONNX, no file system (`std::fs`, `std::net`, `std::process`), no native access or `unsafe` (`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`), no clock except through an injected `Clock` trait (enforcement in 09 §2, ADR-0005 D13).
  - Images enter the core as an own immutable raster type (`ImageRaster`: width, height, ARGB `u32` pixels), file locations as a value object (`FolderLocation`); both live in `shared-kernel`. Decoding, encoding (JPEG/PNG for the upload) and file-system access happen only in adapters; the image codec crates are chosen in M0.
- **Adapters** are cut by **technology** and implement the **ports** (traits) of the context crates. Inside an adapter there is one module per context.
- **`ui`** uses only the public application API of the context crates and `workflows`.
- **`app`** is exclusively composition root and packaging.
- **Visibility:** a context crate exposes two public modules, `api` and `api::model`; everything else is `pub(crate)` (the former `internal` package). A crate that is not a dependency in the context map cannot be named at all, so `Cargo.toml` replaces the JPMS `requires`.

Detailed rules and their enforcement are in [09-engineering-principles.md](09-engineering-principles.md).

Corrected 2026-10-14: the crate directories of the tree (the core, the adapters, `ui` and `app`) live under `crates/`, as the crate-name paragraph below says; `supply-chain/`, `xtask/` and `tools/` stay at the root. The first crate there is `crates/adapter-uex` (issue #24).

**Context map / dependencies** (only in arrow direction, **cycle-free**, enforced by Cargo's dependency graph, the `xtask` rule over `cargo metadata`, Clippy `disallowed_*` and `cargo-deny` `bans`; ADR-0005 D13):

```
shared-kernel  ← every module
game           → shared-kernel
reference-data → shared-kernel
capture        → game
recognition    → reference-data, game
reporting      → recognition (published language: Scan, CardReading, StitchedScan, FieldReading, Finding), reference-data, game
submission     → reference-data, game                 (does NOT know reporting)
workflows      → capture, recognition, reporting, submission, reference-data, game
ui             → workflows + public application API of the context modules
adapter-*      → the context modules whose ports they implement   (adapters are leaves)
app            → all                                  (wires; contains no logic)
tools/ocr-eval → recognition, reference-data, adapter-ocr, adapter-vlm, adapter-files, adapter-uex   (a second composition root – the only other module allowed to depend on adapters; adapter-uex only replays the corpus' recorded reference data, never HTTP, 07 §4)
```

- Each context crate has exactly two public modules: `api` (application services, commands, read models, events, ports as traits) and `api::model` (aggregates and value objects that ports and other contexts must name, e.g. `Report` for `ReportRepository`). Domain services, policies and helpers stay in `pub(crate)` modules. (An earlier version hid the whole model in `internal`; then adapters could not implement repository ports – they cannot name non-exported types.)
- **Protecting aggregates that are exported:** an aggregate is a struct with private fields; its constructor validates all state-local invariants (e.g. I1) and returns a `Result`. The only way to build a value from stored state without the command path is a dedicated reconstitution function that the persistence mapper in `adapter-storage` calls (reconstitution); an `xtask` or Clippy rule allows calls to it only from there. Transitions (I3, I4, I7) are only possible through the command methods (I7: `applyScan`; the merge use case applies the same rule).
- `submission` never references `reporting`. `workflows` converts a released `Report` into a `SubmissionRequest`. This is a `submission` type; it also carries `observedAt`, the age confirmation, the report's game version together with the newest version its R-CAP-3b choice was confirmed against, if any (I5), and the row keys that the send-time checks need. `workflows` applies the submission events back to the report as state changes: `SubmissionDeferred`, `SubmissionSucceeded`, `SubmissionPartiallyAccepted`, `SubmissionOutcomeUnknown`, `SubmissionRejected`, `SubmissionReturned`, `SubmissionCancelled`, `WithdrawalSucceeded`, `WithdrawalFailed` (both per row), `UexReportStatusChanged`, all published by `submission` (mapping in §6). This keeps the context map acyclic.

**Ports** (excerpt, each defined in the context module that owns it):

| Port | Context | Purpose | Implemented in |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Reader` | recognition | read panel → `ReaderResult` | adapter-ocr, adapter-vlm |
| `TextDetector` | recognition | coarse OCR for locate anchors | adapter-ocr |
| `ReferenceDataFetcher` | reference-data | fetch raw reference data from UEX | adapter-uex |
| `ReferenceDataCache` | reference-data | persist/load cached reference data with fetch time | adapter-storage |
| `SubmissionGateway` | submission | send to UEX, withdraw, query status | adapter-uex |
| `CaptureSource` | capture | captures from folders and clipboard monitoring; drag & drop and Ctrl+V arrive as egui input events in `ui`, which passes file paths or image bytes to the capture application API | adapter-files (clipboard change detection: adapter-platform) |
| `CaptureImageLoader` | capture | decode a Capture's file into an `ImageRaster` when its OCR job starts (R-CAP-8 decoding, pixel budget R-OCR-17) | adapter-files |
| `CaptureRepository` / `ScanRepository` / `ReportRepository` / `SubmissionJobRepository`, `CooldownRepository` / `GameObservationRepository` | capture / recognition / reporting / submission / game | persistence (one repository per aggregate); `save(newState, expectedVersion, events)` writes state and outbox rows in one transaction (11 §A6); `ScanRepository` keeps the scans for re-stitching and AI fusion; `GameObservationRepository` holds the observed version history per UEX environment and the observed running channels | adapter-storage |
| `GameLocalizationSource` | game | localised names from `global.ini` | adapter-files |
| `GameLogSource` | game | witness facts from `Game.log` and `build_manifest.id` (kiosk location, buy-side assortment, buy-side container sizes per commodity, branch and build version) with their log time, parsed by the format validated for the game version; player handle and ID are dropped while parsing (R-OCR-20, A24) | adapter-files |
| `CaptureSettingsStore`, `GameSettingsStore`, `ReportingSettingsStore`, `RecognitionSettingsStore`, `AppSettingsStore` | capture / game / reporting / workflows / workflows | user settings per the settings catalogue below, in the versioned config file (R-NF-5) | adapter-files |
| `ImageEncoder` | reporting | encode the composed, redacted upload screenshot | adapter-files |
| `WorkingCopyStore` | workflows | save/load/delete the redacted, perspective-corrected panel crops per `CaptureId` and panel kind (lossless, about 1:1 source scale, R-CAP-7) and the user-selected attachment region per `ReportId` (R-MAN-5) | adapter-files |
| `UpdateCheck` | workflows | "new version available" (R-NF-7, notify only) | adapter-platform |
| `AiJobRepository`, `EventOutbox` | workflows | AI queue persistence; `EventOutbox`: read pending outbox entries, mark them delivered, after-commit notification (11 §A6) | adapter-storage |
| `SecretStore` | submission | store/read the secret key and the user's app token (R-NF-4, O-85) | adapter-platform |
| `GameStateProbe` | game | is Star Citizen running, and from which channel folder? | adapter-platform |
| `Clock` (trait in `shared-kernel`) | all | time (cooldown, hysteresis, grouping) | system clock in `app`, fixed in tests |

**Settings catalogue** (user-editable settings; the defaults are defined in the cited requirement):

| Setting | Owner, port | Applies |
|---|---|---|
| Watched folders: mode, environment rule, subfolders, file types, "only newer than" (R-CAP-1…1e); clipboard monitoring on/off (R-CAP-2) | capture, `CaptureSettingsStore` | live (§4a) |
| Environment mapping to UEX (R-CAP-3a); SC installation path, Wine/Proton prefixes and localisation file (R-CAP-4, R-L10N-2, §8); Game.log witness on/off (R-OCR-20, default off) | game, `GameSettingsStore` | live; a mapping change applies to reports released afterwards |
| Send threshold (07 §2.6), staleness limit (R-UI-11; default from UEX `commodity.ttl`, fallback 15 days), `maxObservationAge` (R-VAL-6), grouping window (R-OCR-13), session gap (R-UI-14), tolerance overrides (effective tolerance, R-VAL-2), test mode (R-SUB-8) | reporting, `ReportingSettingsStore` | at the next assessment or release; test mode only for reports released afterwards (R-SUB-8) |
| AI mode and re-check scope (R-VLM-1, R-VLM-4), Ollama host and its non-loopback/remote-model consent (R-VLM-6), AI model choice (R-VLM-7; compared with the evaluated-model list, S-27), digit threshold (07 §2.6), per-source notice count and "Don't show again" per source (R-OCR-18) | workflows, `RecognitionSettingsStore` | new captures and the next AI job; a non-loopback Ollama host or a remote model only after the consent is recorded |
| UEX base host: a built-in UEX-confirmed host or a confirmed expert custom host (R-API-3; the fallback list is built in, not a setting), update check on/off (R-NF-7), retention per category (R-CAP-7), theme and text size (R-UI-7, R-UI-17) | workflows, `AppSettingsStore` | hosts: new requests only, never an in-flight POST or an `OutcomeUnknown` job (R-SUB-9); retention: next cleanup; theme and text size: live |

Safety thresholds can only be made stricter (R-NF-5): the send threshold, the digit threshold and the staleness limit can only be raised, tolerance overrides can only tighten, and `maxObservationAge` can only be lowered. Release-calibrated values are not user-editable (the same list as R-NF-5 and 09 §3): the confidence ladder (07 §2.6), the R-OCR-17 text-size limits (confirm limit and lower limit), the R-OCR-18 tone thresholds and the R-VAL-6 hard limit. The only exception is the session-only lift of the R-OCR-19 cap, which is never persisted (R-NF-5). The loader replaces an unparsable or out-of-range value with its default, reports it visibly and never uses it (R-NF-5). These release-calibrated values and the other thresholds that are not user-editable (queue parallelism, backoff, rate budgets, hysteresis, polling intervals, the R-OCR-17 pixel budget, which bounds memory per R-NF-3, and the §9 header-check limits) live in the owning module's typed settings record with documented defaults, not in the config file. The `*Wiring` modules in `app` read the stores and pass values to the adapters that need them (`adapter-uex`, `adapter-vlm`, `adapter-files`, `adapter-platform`) as a closure or shared handle backed by the store (for example a `Fn() -> T` or a `tokio::sync::watch` receiver), so a change applies to the next request without a restart. All `*SettingsStore` implementations in `adapter-files` share one `ConfigFile` component. It is the single writer (serialised read-modify-write, temp file plus atomic rename, F17), owns the one schema version and migration ([release-process.md](../release-process.md)) and gives each store its own section.

**Why this split?**

- Bounded-context boundaries are enforced by the compiler (a crate cannot name a crate it does not depend on, and `pub(crate)` hides internals), not only by the `xtask` rule and Clippy.
- Everything about one context, model and use cases, is in one crate.
- A change stays local: an SC UI patch touches `recognition` and `adapter-ocr`; a UEX API change touches `adapter-uex`.
- Use cases are **testable without egui, network and database**, using fakes of the ports.
- A technology change (OCR model, secret store, UI) affects exactly one adapter.
- The disadvantages (more crates, explicit translation between contexts, more expensive re-cuts, shared-kernel growth) and their handling are documented in ADR-0002.

Crate names (O-122, decided 2026-10-13): every workspace member's package name is the directory name above with the prefix `tallyline-` (`tallyline-game`, `tallyline-adapter-uex`, …), so that no workspace crate can be mistaken for a registry crate of the same name; the directories under `crates/` carry no prefix. The binary is `tallyline`. `xtask` and `tools/ocr-eval` keep their names.

`shared-kernel`:

```rust
/// Result of a command: new state plus domain events, or a domain refusal (`R` is the refusing context's closed reason-code type).
pub enum Outcome<T, R> {
    Ok { state: T, events: Vec<DomainEvent> },
    Refused(R),
}
```

The domain model (Bounded Contexts, aggregates, invariants I1–I7, events, Ubiquitous Language) is in [11-ddd-and-tdd.md](11-ddd-and-tdd.md). This section only shows its form in code.

- **Naming:** the prose of the documents keeps the domain spelling of command and type names (`applyScan`, `markMissing`); in Rust code the same names are `snake_case` functions (`apply_scan`, `mark_missing`) and `CamelCase` types. The excerpt above is a signature sketch, not final code: the `Timestamp` instant type, the decimal type behind `PricePerScu`, `HashMap`/`HashSet` imports and the derive lists are chosen in M0. A closed set is a plain `enum` (variants may carry data), matched exhaustively without a wildcard arm; `#[non_exhaustive]` is used only on types that cross the workspace boundary into a public API, and there are none in the plan.
- **Money:** a decimal type (crate chosen in M0), never `f64`. Since SC 4.7 the game shows whole aUEC; the API accepts float.
- **`ImageRaster`** is the one value type that is not a plain data struct: the pixel buffer is private and immutable after construction (shared by reference counting, so clones are cheap), there is no mutable accessor, and equality and hash run over the dimensions and the pixels. It lives in `shared-kernel`, because `capture`, `recognition` and `reporting` all use it.
- **Decoding is not recognition:** format detection by magic bytes, colour conversion to sRGB and the decode-time reduction above the pixel budget (R-CAP-8, R-OCR-17) happen in `adapter-files` while decoding; together with upload encoding they are the only pixel operations outside the core. HDR-encoded files never become an `ImageRaster` (they are set aside).
- **Pattern matching:** Pipeline results are enums with data (`ScanResult::Located | NotLocated | WrongScreen`; decision rule in 07 §2.1 item 3) and are evaluated with an exhaustive `match`.
- **Report-level and row commands** are allowed only in `Draft`; in any other state they return `Outcome::Refused`. The exceptions are the lifecycle commands `release`, `splitByContainerSizes` (in `Released`, before the job is created), `returnToDraft`, `cancel`, `splitOffCooldownRows` (in `WaitingForCooldown`), `applyWithdrawal` and `duplicateAsDraft`, and the transitions that apply submission events (§6 table) or the user's `OutcomeUnknown` resolution (11 §A3).
- **Key change** (terminal, side or environment = the grouping key, R-OCR-13): the aggregate records the new key, drops the confirmations of rows whose commodity changes and emits `ReportKeyChanged`. For an environment change, `workflows` passes the version valid at the capture time in that environment's history (R-CAP-3b). `workflows` then re-runs recognition stages 4–6 on the report's stored scans with the chosen terminal fixed and the reference data of the chosen side and environment (R-API-6); for a manual report only validation and deviation are re-run. Other rows keep their confirmations under the R-VAL-7 rule (kept unless the deviation level gets worse). If a Draft with the same key exists within the grouping window, the app offers a merge (R-OCR-13, R-UI-14) and never merges silently; duplicate commodities are resolved by the stitching rule (07 §2.5b) and shown to the user.
- **Return from submission:** `workflows` maps `SubmissionReturned(reason)` to a `ReportFinding` and calls `returnToDraft`. A report-fixable `SubmissionError` of `submission` (R-SUB-11) becomes `ReturnedForFix(FixableReason)`, so no UEX code enters `reporting`; a version change at the send attempt becomes `GameVersionChanged`, and the report is "to be checked" (I5).
- **Report-level findings** (`ReportFinding`): `CaptureTimeUncertain` comes from the capture-time rule (R-CAP-5) and is resolved by `correctObservedAt`; while it is open, stitching and grouping do not decide by capture time (R-OCR-11, R-OCR-13), and `workflows` passes that uncertainty with the scans. The other findings record why a job came back (§6).
- **Environment confirmation** (R-CAP-10, manual reports, from M4; default, an owner question in [08](08-review.md)): the confirmation is report-level state of the Report (`EnvironmentConfirmation`: the running channel it was given against and the time), not a `ReportFinding`. The gate takes the running channel from `ReleaseContext.runningChannel`. If that channel maps (R-CAP-3a, the same mapping as for `EnvironmentUnmapped`) to another UEX environment than the Report's `env`, and the Report has no `EnvironmentConfirmation` for that channel, `evaluate` returns `Blocked` with `EnvironmentUnconfirmed(runningChannel)` (I2). `confirmEnvironment(runningChannel, now)` records it; a different running channel at a later release attempt needs a new confirmation, and `changeEnvironment` revokes it (I3). No running game, or an unknown channel, is never a mismatch. OCR reports are cross-checked at import instead (Capture state `EnvironmentPending`, §4a), so the gate does not apply this check to them.
- **Rows:** an `ObservedRow` has a stable `RowId`, assigned when the row is built from the `StitchedScan` and kept by re-stitching for the same commodity (or, for an unresolved card, the same source card); a `MissingRow` gets its `RowId` from `markMissing`. `selectCommodity` re-runs the prior-dependent steps for that row (price candidate choice and repair, 07 §2.5 item 3; deviation) through `reporting → recognition`, and drops the row's price, SCU and status confirmations (I3). If another row already has that commodity, it merges the two rows with the R-OCR-11 conflict rule (07 §2.5b) and shows the merge. Excluded rows are not sent; `ReportReleased` carries only resolved, non-excluded rows, so cooldown and job keys always have a resolved `CommodityId`.
- **Side:** `Scan`/`StitchedScan` carry the side as `FieldReading<TradeSide>` with findings (`Ambiguous`, `Inconsistent`); the Report copies it into `Field<TradeSide>` (07 §2.1 item 7).
- **Container-size split** (R-OCR-9, decided 2026-10-09, O-92): `data_submit` takes one `container_sizes` per report. The release use case in `workflows` calls `splitByContainerSizes()` on the Released Report: its sent rows are grouped by the identical container-size set they send (a set is sent only if it passes I2 itself, 11 §A1 "Mandatory field"), and rows without a sent set form one group without the field. One group keeps the Report; every other group becomes its own Released Report with disjoint rows that keeps the header, `observedAt`, captures, confirmations, age confirmation and faction affinity, like `splitOffCooldownRows`. Each Released Report is one `data_submit` with the same composed screenshot (R-SUB-7); the history links them as parts of one capture.
- **Withdrawal per row** (I4, R-SUB-4, decided 2026-10-09, O-89): `applyWithdrawal` records the row's `RowWithdrawal` result from the submission events (§6). A row may be withdrawn only while it has a verified UEX report ID and its last `data_info` answer has `is_editable` = 1. The Report state stays `Submitted` or `PartiallyAccepted` while some accepted rows are not withdrawn, and moves to `Withdrawn` when every accepted row is withdrawn.

## 4. Recognition pipeline (`recognition`, readers in `adapter-ocr`)

Details and derivation are in [07-ocr-concept.md](07-ocr-concept.md). Short version:

Locate needs a coarse OCR for the text anchors. So that `recognition` does not depend on `adapter-ocr`, the port `TextDetector` (in `recognition`) is injected into it for this purpose.

| Stage | Input → output | Key techniques |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Locate | `ImageRaster` → panel quad(s), text-size and tone assessment | Box-filter downscale (factor ≤ 1, native-resolution retry, tiling for very wide frames; 07 §2.1 item 1); text anchors from a coarse OCR pass ("SHOP INVENTORY", "YOUR INVENTORIES"); luma-gradient frame edges with relative thresholds (no theme colour); homography to a working size set by the reference glyph height; text-size gate (R-OCR-17); per-panel tone analysis and normalisation (R-OCR-18); manual fallback |
| 2 OCR | Normalised image → `Vec<TextBox>` (polygon, text, line score, and per character the probability and the x-span of the CTC frames that emitted it) | PP-OCRv6 small det (DBNet) + rec (CTC) via ONNX Runtime through the `ort` crate (ADR-0005 D2; the runtime version follows the `ort` pin, fixed in M0), full dictionary |
| 3 Layout | TextBoxes → `Vec<Card>` + header | Cards via borders/spacing and the label "AVAILABLE CARGO SIZE"; card completeness from geometry (07 §2.3); field roles by position and suffix, relative to the card (07 §2.3); section headers and side text read only inside the shop panel, section per card (07 §2.3); tab recognition by comparing the tab fills (relative luminance and saturation) with the shop-panel text as witness – disagreement gives side `Inconsistent`, both abstaining gives `Ambiguous` (07 §2.1 item 7) |
| 4 Parsing + resolution (per reader) | Cards → parsed field candidates (price/SCU as decimal candidates incl. currency-prefix and confusable variants at uncertain positions, status, cargo sizes) + commodity and terminal candidates | Field parsers per 07 §2.4 (shared number parser; unit and currency-glyph handling only for OCR tokens); normalisation (upper/lower case, whitespace, ligatures) plus weighted Levenshtein/Jaro-Winkler against the global vocabulary of the environment; terminal candidates from the location field with the assortment check per candidate; assortment pass for unexpected commodities (07 §2.5 items 1–2) |
| 4b Fusion (only if a VLM reading is present) | Per-reader candidates → fused candidates per field | Rules over the per-reader candidate sets, only for cards that Layout marked complete (07 §2.7) |
| 5 Validation (once, on the fused result) | Fused candidates → `FieldReading<T>` (value, confidence, findings, source region) | Candidate scoring with UEX prior and effective tolerances (R-VAL-2), confusable repair with the witness rule (R-VAL-2b), glyph-topology witness and veto, status↔SCU and other consistency rules, confidence (07 §2.5, §2.6) |
| 6 Stitching | Scans of one report group → `StitchedScan` (a `recognition` type whose rows carry `FieldReading`s) | **Grouping comes first:** `ReportGrouper` (`reporting`) assigns each scan to a report group from its grouping data (resolved or unresolved terminal, side, environment, capture time; R-OCR-13). `workflows` builds that data from the capture and its scan, because `reporting` does not depend on `capture`. `workflows` then loads the group's scans (`ScanRepository`), calls `StitchingService::stitch(&[Scan])` and hands the `StitchedScan` to `reporting`, which creates or updates the Draft (optimistic `version` check; fields with origin `USER` or a confirmation are never replaced, I7). Merge via `CommodityId` (simpler than in basetool thanks to resolution); edge card rule; conflicting readings per 07 §2.5b item 5 (`Ambiguous`, or `Superseded` at confirm). The `StitchedScan` also carries the per-section coverage (expanded, gap-free) that R-VAL-5 needs; `reporting` keeps it as the Report's `Coverage`. Re-stitch triggers: a capture joins a Draft, a scan's terminal is resolved later (regrouping), a user split or merge, a key change (§3), an AI fusion that stored a new scan. |

## 4a. Image input (`capture`, technology in `adapter-files`)

```rust
pub struct WatchedFolder {
    pub location: FolderLocation,
    pub enabled: bool,
    pub mode: ImportMode,
    pub recursive: bool,
    pub extensions: HashSet<String>,
    pub environment: EnvironmentChoice,
    pub only_newer_than: Option<Timestamp>,
}

pub enum ImportMode { Manual, Automatic }
```

- **`onlyNewerThan`** (`only_newer_than`) is set when a folder is added (default: time of adding minus the R-VAL-6 hard limit, R-CAP-1) and is `None` only after the explicit "Also import older files" choice. `FolderScanner` applies it to the capture time (R-CAP-5) before the register match, for the Import button, the watcher and the catch-up scan; skipped files are not written to the register.
- **Working copies** (R-CAP-7): after locate, the perspective-corrected panel crops are stored at about 1:1 source scale (not at the working size, so re-reads keep the source legibility; 07 §2.1 item 4). They are **redacted before anything is persisted**: a pure `ImageRaster` function in `recognition` applies the crop extent of R-SUB-7 and fills any part of a crop quad that reaches into the terminal header band, using relative geometry only (R-OCR-17). `workflows` stores them through the `WorkingCopyStore` port (`adapter-files`, data directory per §8). All later steps (review, VLM, upload and the R-QA-5/R-NF-6 exports) work only on these crops. Enforced by type: the crop step returns its own redacted-crop type, the only type that the working-copy store, the VLM request, `ImageEncoder` and the export use cases accept for panel crops; the type has a private field and one constructor, visible only inside the crop step's module (`pub(super)`), so no other code can build it. (The user-selected attachment region of a manual report is the one exception; it is guarded by the confirmed full-size preview of R-SUB-7.) `workflows` also runs the R-CAP-7 retention and the R-NF-9 deletion, because only it knows both capture and report states. Retention (R-CAP-7) is decided by an exhaustive `match` over `ReportState` (no wildcard arm), so a new state cannot be added without a retention rule; a purge test covers every state.
- The types above live in `capture`; **`FolderScanner`, `FolderWatcher` and `StableFileGate` live in `adapter-files`** (they touch the file system) and deliver new files through the `CaptureSource` port. `CaptureSource` delivers either a checked file (its `FileFingerprint` and source; the pixels are decoded later through `CaptureImageLoader`, see `StableFileGate`) or an intake result "set aside" with its reason (R-CAP-8, R-CAP-1c) that is recorded in the processed-file register and never becomes a Capture (11 §A3).
- **`FolderScanner`**: It lists the candidates (a directory walk that does not follow links, walker crate or `std::fs` chosen in M0, §9 "Untrusted input"; extension filter plus the known HDR container extensions, R-CAP-8), matches them against the **processed-file register** (path, size and mtime as a fast key, content hash as identity) and returns the new files lazily, as a stream rather than a complete list. It is used by the "Import" button and the catch-up scan.
- **`FolderWatcher`** per folder in mode `AUTOMATIC`:
  - A file-system notification crate (chosen in M0) on a task of the I/O runtime; on an overflow event a full scan follows.
  - Subfolders (option `recursive`) are registered one by one, including newly created ones (Linux inotify has no recursive watch; whether the crate's recursive mode is used on Windows is decided in M0); links and junctions are not registered, so there are no cycles.
  - If registration fails or the file system is known to be unreliable (FUSE and network mounts such as SMB/NFS; a Wine prefix is a normal local directory where inotify works), polling is used instead (`FolderScanner` every 2 s). Polling can be forced per folder.
- **`StableFileGate`**: waits until size and mtime are stable for a quiet period. A file whose content (magic bytes) is an unsupported format (R-CAP-8) is then handed over at once as "set aside" with its reason, without decode retries. Before the first decode it runs the header check and registers the file in state `decoding` (§9 "Untrusted input"). A supported format must decode; otherwise it is retried (R-CAP-1c). This check decode runs on the bounded intake pool (§7), never on the watcher's async task, and its raster is discarded at once. A file that passes becomes a `Capture` in state `Imported` (path, size, mtime, content hash; no pixels), persisted through `CaptureRepository`; the capture queue is the set of persisted Captures not yet scanned (`Imported`, `EnvironmentPending`, `Ready`; the "pending files" of R-CAP-1e) and never holds rasters. The OCR job decodes the file again through `CaptureImageLoader` on its OCR worker. Captures without a file (bitmap data from Ctrl+V, drag & drop or clipboard monitoring) are first written losslessly as PNG into an `inbox` folder in the data directory and then handled like files; the inbox file is deleted once the working copies are stored, with the failed capture (R-CAP-7), or, for a capture set aside as not located or not a terminal, when the user decides and at the latest at the end of the "failed captures" retention (R-OCR-16).
- **From `Imported` to `Ready`** (default, an owner question in [08](08-review.md)): a Capture waits in `Imported` until the first successful `game_versions` fetch for its environment has been recorded (R-CAP-3b). One response covers `live` and `ptu` ([06](06-uex-api.md)), so in practice this wait only occurs while the version history is still empty (first install, offline first start, R-UI-13). Then `workflows` moves the Capture on, in the `ReferenceDataRefreshed` handler (§5) or at import if the fetch already happened: to `EnvironmentPending` if its environment is unknown, the folder asks for every image, or a known channel observed at the capture time maps to another UEX environment (R-CAP-10); otherwise to `Ready`, with the version for its capture time derived and classified per R-CAP-3b (uncertain if the capture time lies before the first observation; `UNKNOWN` if UEX reports no version for the environment). `assignEnvironment` moves an `EnvironmentPending` Capture to `Ready` the same way. A failed refresh before versioning (`versionStampMaxAge`, R-CAP-3b) does not hold a Capture once a fetch was recorded; its version is classified from the existing history (provisional if the capture time is after the last successful fetch). Waiting Captures stay in the capture queue and show their reason there. Only `Ready` Captures reach the OCR pipeline (§7).
- **Clipboard and drag & drop:**
  - Drag & drop and Ctrl+V are handled in `ui` on the UI thread (egui input events). `ui` passes only file paths or the image bytes to the capture application API; decoding stays in `adapter-files`, off the UI thread. Captures without a file follow the inbox rule of the `StableFileGate` bullet.
  - Clipboard monitoring (opt-in, default off, R-CAP-2) runs in two stages. (1) Cheap change detection in `adapter-platform` through the platform API (the only `unsafe` crate, ADR-0005 D1): Windows `GetClipboardSequenceNumber`; Linux per A23. The poll interval is a typed setting (start value 1 s, to be measured). (2) Only after a detected change is the clipboard read, and only image content, never text. Whether the read uses the egui/eframe clipboard (one hop to the UI thread through the channel of §7) or a clipboard crate in `adapter-files` is decided in M3 and recorded here. Decoding and fingerprinting run on the bounded intake pool (§7), never on the UI thread.
- Settings are applied live: if a folder switches between MANUAL and AUTOMATIC, the watcher starts or stops without restarting the app.

## 4b. Optional AI recognition (`adapter-vlm`, `adapter-platform`, control in `workflows`)

- **Reader abstraction** (in `recognition`):

  ```rust
  pub enum ReaderKind { Ocr, Vlm }

  /// An ordinary open trait: the implementations live in other crates (`adapter-ocr`, `adapter-vlm`). The call blocks and runs on a bounded worker, never on the async runtime or the UI thread.
  pub trait Reader {
      fn read(&self, panel: &NormalizedPanel) -> Result<ReaderResult, ReaderError>;
  }

  pub struct ReaderResult {
      pub kind: ReaderKind,
      pub cards: Vec<RawCard>,
      pub header: Option<RawHeader>,
      pub took: Duration,
  }
  ```

  The classic OCR and the VLM deliver the same raw structure: `RawCard` with field-typed raw strings (name, status, quantity text, price text, cargo sizes). For OCR, Layout assigns the fields by position and suffix (07 §2.3); for the VLM, the table column does. **Order:**

  1. Parsing and resolution (stage 4) run **per reader**.
  2. Then follows the **fusion** per field over the per-reader candidate sets (rules in [07](07-ocr-concept.md) §2.7). It runs only for cards that Layout (stage 3) marked complete in that capture; VLM rows without such a card are discarded (`PartialCard`).
  3. Validation, repair and confidence (stage 5) run **once** on the fused result.
  4. Finally, stitching (stage 6) follows.

  The VLM reads per capture; after an AI run, the affected report is re-stitched. Only reports in state `Draft` are touched (R-VLM-4); the write uses the report's `version` (optimistic concurrency), so a concurrent user edit wins and the AI result is re-applied on top of the edited state (never on fields with origin `USER` or a confirmation; a differing AI reading is only shown as a hint, 07 §2.7).

- **`GameProcessMonitor`** (`adapter-platform`, implements `GameStateProbe`):
  - Periodically checks on a task of the I/O runtime: Windows via a Toolhelp snapshot (platform API through the `windows` crate or an equivalent chosen in M0; image name `StarCitizen.exe`, no handle to other processes; the `…\Bin64\…` path only as a hint, R-VLM-2); Linux via `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` and `/proc/<pid>/comm`, because the process image there is the Wine binary and the game name is in argv (assumption A7). Undeterminable state counts as RUNNING.
  - Publishes the states `RUNNING` and `CLOSED` with hysteresis through the `GameStateProbe` port (a `tokio::sync::watch` channel or callback → `GameStateChanged` event). `RUNNING` carries the channel folder taken from the executable path (`…\StarCitizen\<CHANNEL>\Bin64\StarCitizen.exe`; Linux per A7), or `unknown`; the `game` context keeps a timestamped history of observed channels in `GameObservationRepository` for the environment cross-check (R-CAP-10). The `ui` maps the event to a field of its state; no egui types outside `ui`.
  - Opens no handles to other processes for detection and has no further permissions.

- **`RecognitionPolicy`** (`workflows`) decides, based on the setting (Off / Automatic / Always) and the game state, whether the AI queue may work:

  | Setting | Game running | Game closed |
  |---|---|---|
  | Off | OCR only | OCR only |
  | Automatic | OCR only; reports are flagged for the AI | AI queue runs (only reports with warnings or all) |
  | Always | OCR + AI (warning) | OCR + AI |

- **AI queue** (`workflows`, persistence via `AiJobRepository` in `adapter-storage`):
  - One `AiJob` per capture of a `Draft` report (flagged reports, or every Draft with "all", R-VLM-4), one after the other (the VLM uses the GPU exclusively).
  - Job states: `Pending → Running → Done | Failed(reason) | Obsolete`; `Pending/Running → Cancelled` (user cancel, R-VLM-4: a running request is cancelled and the model unloaded with `keep_alive: 0`; the remaining pending jobs of that run are cancelled too). `Pending` may carry the resume reason `INTERRUPTED_BY_GAME_START`.
  - **A queue pause is not a job failure:** Ollama not reachable, model missing, Ollama below the minimum version, mode Off, or the game running in mode Automatic pause the queue with that reason. Its jobs stay `Pending` and a running job returns to `Pending`. The reason is shown in the status area and the settings only, never as an error (R-VLM-7, R-VLM-12).
  - **`Failed`** (terminal; retried only when the user asks): `TRUNCATED` (still truncated after the single retry, R-VLM-10), `UNPARSEABLE`, `CROP_UNAVAILABLE` (working copy expired, R-CAP-7). A request timeout is transient: the job returns to `Pending`, with a bounded attempt count (setting, start value 3). On failure the report keeps its OCR result, and the queue row shows an info note.
  - **`Obsolete`:** the job's report is no longer `Draft` when the job starts or finishes; the result is discarded (R-VLM-4).
  - While a job is running, the game monitor checks at a 2 s interval instead of a 5 s interval.
  - On switching to `RUNNING` (mode Automatic): cancel the in-flight request (dropping its future or a cancellation token; best effort, the server may still finish it), send the unload request (`keep_alive: 0`) independently, then verify via `/api/ps` that the model is gone – retry until the 5 s target; the running job returns to `Pending(INTERRUPTED_BY_GAME_START)`. Ollama only unloads after the server has finished the cancelled request, hence the verification.
  - Every request sends `keep_alive` explicitly (the server-side `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` may differ from the 5 min default).
  - When the queue is empty: unload the model after a short time (default `keep_alive` 5 min).

- **`OllamaClient`** (`adapter-vlm`): `reqwest` and `serde` JSON (ADR-0005 D4; the JSON crate is confirmed in M0); endpoints `/api/version`, `/api/tags`, `/api/show`, `/api/ps`, `/api/pull` (streaming progress) and `/api/chat` (`stream: false`, `images` as Base64, `options.temperature = 0`).
  - **Host check:** loopback host per R-VLM-6 (literal check, no DNS lookup); other hosts only after confirmation. For a loopback host the client is built with proxying disabled (`reqwest::ClientBuilder::no_proxy`), so OS proxy settings cannot route the crops. Confirmed non-loopback hosts follow the system proxy like UEX (§8).
  - **Remote-model check:** the local server forwards cloud models to ollama.com, so the host check alone is not enough. A model is remote if `/api/show` or `/api/tags` reports `remote_host`/`remote_model`; the tag suffix `:cloud`/`-cloud` is a second check. The check runs before every job and fails closed, and every chat response is checked again (R-VLM-6).
  - **Evaluated models:** after `/api/pull` and every `/api/tags` call, the model digest is compared with the evaluated-model list resource (tag, digest(s), approximate size; R-VLM-11, S-27). There is no size query before a pull; the dialog uses the shipped approximate size (R-VLM-7).

## 5. Reference data (`reference-data`, fetching in `adapter-uex`, cache in `adapter-storage`)

- The endpoints and TTLs are in [06-uex-api.md](06-uex-api.md). At startup, data is loaded from the cache (immediately usable), then refreshed in the background.
- **In-memory indexes:**
  - Commodity names (EN, localised, code)
  - Terminal names, nicknames and display names
  - Location names
  - Assortment per terminal
  - Status levels per side
- The **price prior** is loaded on demand when a terminal is opened or recognised (`commodities_prices?id_terminal=`) and cached (30 min).
- **Effective tolerance** (R-VAL-2) is computed once in `reference-data` from `DataParameters` and the tolerance settings; `recognition` (repair scoring) and `reporting` (`DeviationAssessor`) use the same value. The effective staleness limit (R-UI-11) is computed the same way: `commodity.ttl` in days, raised by the user setting, or the settings default of 15 days while `ttl` is unavailable (O-95).
- **Vocabulary filters:** player-owned terminals (`is_player_owned` = 1) and refinery terminals (`commodity_raw`) are not part of the terminal vocabulary (R-MAN-1, R-OCR-8); the `commodity_raw` terminals (`/terminals?type=commodity_raw`, query form unverified) are loaded only to recognise refinery screens as unsupported. Text fields are HTML-unescaped once in `adapter-uex` before indexing (R-API-5).
- **Persistence:** SQLite (`rusqlite` with bundled SQLite, a registered exception, ADR-0005 D2), tables `ref_*` with raw JSON and extracted index columns; schema migrations versioned (simple custom migration script, no ORM).
- **Observed game versions** (R-CAP-3b): a `workflows` handler for `ReferenceDataRefreshed` passes every `game_versions` value from a successful network fetch, with its fetch time, to the `game` application service, which updates first and last seen per UEX environment. Loading the cache at startup is never an observation. The send-time fetch of `submission` (§6) also goes through `reference-data` and publishes `ReferenceDataRefreshed`, so every successful fetch is an observation ([06](06-uex-api.md)). After recording a fetch, `workflows` moves the Captures waiting in `Imported` on (§4a) and re-classifies the `PROVISIONAL` versions of the Draft reports of that environment (`reclassifyVersion`, R-CAP-3b); queued reports are covered by the send-time check (§6).

## 6. Submission (`reporting` gate, `submission` queue, HTTP in `adapter-uex`, persistence in `adapter-storage`)

- **Responsibilities:**
  - `reporting`: submission gate, grouping (a report is released only if the gate passes).
  - `submission` (`SubmissionService`): queue states, cooldown, **retry policy** (when and how often to retry), rate budgets: 120 requests/min as an in-memory token bucket, and 1000 report rows/30 min as a sliding window over the persisted attempt records (`SubmissionJobRepository`: start and row count per attempt), so it survives a restart (R-SUB-2). Before every attempt it runs the send-time checks: the acceptance flags and `game_versions`, at most 15 min old, requested through `reference-data`'s application API so that every successful fetch is also a version observation (§5, R-SUB-5); the observation age (R-VAL-6); and newer observations (R-VAL-8). A closed flag, or no fresh state, holds the job. The job is returned if the current version of the report's environment differs from the report's version and from the version its R-CAP-3b choice was confirmed against, if the age check fails, or if a newer observation was already sent.
  - `workflows`: runs the release use case, which reads the account standing and the screenshot policy from `submission`'s API and the environment of the running game's channel from `game`'s API (none if the game is closed or the channel is unknown; R-CAP-10, from M4), and passes them to the gate as `ReleaseContext` (§3; there is no `reporting → submission` dependency). With a mismatching running channel and no `EnvironmentConfirmation` for it, the gate refuses a manual report with `EnvironmentUnconfirmed` (§3; default, an owner question). `workflows` also hands released reports to `submission` and applies the results back to `reporting`.
  - `adapter-uex` (`UexSubmissionGateway`): JSON payload, HTTP, **one attempt per call**, through the one shared `reqwest` client of `adapter-uex` with the typed send timeout of `SubmissionRetrySettings` (start value 90 s, R-SUB-2, O-103). Every UEX request carries `User-Agent` and `X-Client-Version` with the build version (R-API-7, O-86). It has no own retries and enables no automatic retry of non-idempotent requests in the HTTP stack. Amended 2026-10-12: the earlier check of the JDK 27 client source no longer applies; in the M0 API spike the behaviour of `reqwest` and its HTTP stack for a POST (repeated at most after a failed connect or when the server marked the request as unprocessed) is verified at source and recorded here. The gateway surfaces `Retry-After` and maps answers and errors to `submission` error types, including the not-processed/unknown distinction of R-SUB-9.
  - `adapter-storage`: persistence.
- **Payload building** (in `adapter-uex`): one list `prices[]` per report. Buy rows contain `price_buy`/`scu_buy`/`status_buy`, sell rows the `_sell` fields. In addition there are `container_sizes` (only when it is sent: the one set shared by every row of this report after the container-size split, §3, 11 §A1 "Mandatory field"), `date_added` (`observedAt` in Unix seconds, R-VAL-6, O-91), `faction_affinity` (only when the user entered it, R-SUB-13), `screenshot` (Base64 without `data:` prefix; the encoded string is at most 10,000,000 bytes, R-SUB-7, O-98), `game_version` and `is_production`. A `MissingRow` becomes a row with `id_commodity` and `is_missing = 1`; which other fields it may or must carry is open ([06](06-uex-api.md) open point 12), so marking missing is offered only once that point is verified.
- **Queue:**
  - persistent in SQLite. Job phases: `queued` → `waiting-for-cooldown` (ETA) → `sending`; `held` (acceptance closed, or no acceptance state at most 15 min old could be fetched, R-SUB-5, R-SUB-11; "API changed" after an HTML HTTP 404 on a write, which holds the whole queue; or the retry limit for the not-processed set is reached, with "retry now"/"cancel"); `paused` (account, R-SUB-11: "re-authentication required", "app token missing or invalid", or a key error that the read-only `GET /user` re-check did not confirm, with "retry now"). Final phases: `succeeded`, `partially-accepted`, `outcome-unknown`, `rejected`, `returned` (with a reason) and `cancelled` (by the user, only before `sending`). There is no generic "failed" phase.
  - **restart and interrupted sends** (R-SUB-2, R-SUB-9): before the request is handed to the HTTP client, the phase `sending` and the attempt record (start, row count, payload hash) are committed in their own SQLite transaction (write-ahead). At startup, a job still in `sending` (crash, kill) becomes `outcome-unknown` and is never queued again; every other unfinished job ends as `returned` (reason restart), so its report goes back to Draft for renewed release. On shutdown the app waits for in-flight sends up to a bounded time (setting), then marks them `outcome-unknown`. `cancel` is refused once a job is `sending`.
  - error classes and their handling: R-SUB-11; unknown outcomes are never retried automatically and never sent to the fallback host (R-SUB-9)
  - async tasks on the I/O runtime (tokio, ADR-0005 D4)
  - strictly serial: at most one `data_submit` in flight in total (parallelism 1, a typed setting that is not user-editable; R-SUB-2; decided 2026-10-09, O-103, replacing the earlier `Semaphore` of 2)
  - token bucket 120/min (in memory; after a restart, unsent reports need renewed release anyway, and the bucket refills within a minute)
  - retry with exponential backoff only for the not-processed set of R-SUB-9 (connect-phase failures, 429, `requests_limit_reached`), respecting `Retry-After` up to a maximum backoff (setting; a larger value counts as "transient, retry later", subject to R-VAL-6) and bounded by `SubmissionRetrySettings` (decided in `submission`, executed by calling the gateway again). Every other failure after sending began is an unknown outcome. The gateway classifies a connect-phase timeout as a connect failure (not processed) before the general timeout class (unknown outcome), because both surface as a timeout; a test pins the order.
- **Job phases → Report states** (applied by `workflows`; the Report changes only on these events, and the queue view shows the current job phase from the `submission` read model):

  | Job phase | Report state ([11 §A3](11-ddd-and-tdd.md)) | Event from `submission` |
  |---|---|---|
  | `queued`, `sending`, `held`, `paused` | `Queued` | none; `workflows` sets `Queued` from the result of the enqueue call |
  | `waiting-for-cooldown` | `WaitingForCooldown` (ETA) | `SubmissionDeferred(eta)` |
  | `succeeded` | `Submitted` | `SubmissionSucceeded` |
  | `partially-accepted` | `PartiallyAccepted` | `SubmissionPartiallyAccepted` |
  | `outcome-unknown` | `OutcomeUnknown` | `SubmissionOutcomeUnknown` |
  | `rejected` (class *permanent*) | `Rejected` | `SubmissionRejected` |
  | `returned` (reason: report-fixable code, observation age, newer observation sent, game version changed since capture (R-CAP-3b, R-SUB-5, I5), duplicate after unknown outcome, restart) | `Draft` with a report-level finding | `SubmissionReturned(reason)` |
  | `cancelled` (user; refused once `sending`) | `Draft`; for a split requested by "send the others now" (R-SUB-4), `splitOffCooldownRows` instead (11 §A3) | `SubmissionCancelled(reason: USER \| SPLIT)` |

  Withdrawal is a `submission` command **per row** (decided 2026-10-09, O-89): it calls `data_remove` once for each selected row with a verified UEX report ID whose last `data_info` answer has `is_editable` = 1, and publishes one event per row: `WithdrawalSucceeded(row)`, or `WithdrawalFailed(row, reason)` with the reason `ALREADY_CONSOLIDATED` (`report_consolidated`), another UEX code, or an unknown outcome, which is reported as such and never repeated automatically. `workflows` applies `Report.applyWithdrawal(row, result)` for each event (I4); the Report becomes `Withdrawn` only when every accepted row is withdrawn, and otherwise shows the per-row results. A successful withdrawal lifts that row's cooldown (R-SUB-4) and reverts its local prior update (R-VAL-7).
- **Cooldown:** key `CooldownKey(user, mode, terminal, commodity)` (R-SUB-4) – conservatively without side and environment until assumption A12 is clarified. It is persistent and set per row as R-SUB-4 lists (success, partial acceptance, unknown outcome provisionally, `duplicated_report`); the UI shows the remaining time. `duplicated_report` (class *cooldown*, R-SUB-11) sets the cooldown for every row key of the report, since UEX does not name the row; the job waits and is sent again automatically. Exception: if one of the row keys has an `OutcomeUnknown` attempt within the evidence window, the answer is evidence (not proof, A12) that the earlier attempt arrived. The job is then `returned` (finding `PossiblyAlreadyReceived`), and the evidence is attached to the earlier report (R-SUB-9). `until` is the local `Clock` instant at which the response was received (for an unknown outcome, the end of the attempt), plus the cooldown duration (conservative, because receipt follows the server's insert). A wall-clock jump can shorten it; the `duplicated_report` handling above absorbs that (known limitation).
- **Order per key** (R-VAL-8): jobs of one user and mode that share (terminal, commodity, side) are dispatched oldest `observedAt` first, also after a cooldown wait. Before each attempt, `submission` checks against its history (`observedAt` per sent row key) that no newer observation of a row key was already sent; otherwise it returns the job (`SubmissionReturned`, reason newer observation sent).
- **Screenshot per report:** `workflows` loads the redacted working copies (R-CAP-7, R-SUB-7) from `WorkingCopyStore`: the shop-panel crop of every capture in the report and the location-field crop (for a manual report, the attachment region instead, R-MAN-5). `reporting` puts the location field once (from the first capture) above the shop crops, which are stacked vertically in scrollbar order, and re-applies the header-band fill from each crop's recorded geometry, idempotently and as defence in depth (pure raster operations, tested). `ImageEncoder` (adapter-files) encodes JPEG/PNG whose base64 string stays at most 10,000,000 bytes (R-SUB-7, O-98).
- **History:** `ids_reports` with the per-row mapping (accepted with a verified ID, accepted with an unverified ID, not accepted, unmapped; R-SUB-9), each UEX report ID stored with the `date_added` returned with it (IDs repeat across UEX partitions), timestamp, `observedAt`, payload hash, attempt records, response status, the per-row UEX lifecycle status and the per-row withdrawal result; link `https://uexcorp.space/data/info/id/<id>`.
- **Row mapping and lifecycle polling** (R-SUB-4, R-SUB-9; decided 2026-10-09, O-88, O-103): `submission` maps a returned UEX report ID to a row only after a `data_info` lookup shows the row's terminal, commodity and `date_added`, never by position alone. A poller in `submission` reads `data_info` with the Bearer token and secret key (`username` filter, `limit=100`) at most every 5 minutes while rows are not final, and on the user's refresh at most once a minute; a row stops being polled at `consolidated`, `declined` or `expired`, or 14 days after sending. Status changes are published as events (`UexReportStatusChanged(row, status)`); `workflows` reverts the local prior update of a row that becomes `declined` or `expired` (R-VAL-7). Its reads do not occupy the single `data_submit` slot, and they count against the 120/min bucket.

## 7. UI (`ui`, egui/eframe 0.36)

- **State per view:** each view is a function of an owned state value. `update` draws the view from its state and returns commands; the drawing code holds no logic. Commands go through channels to the application APIs of the context crates and `workflows`; dependencies are passed to the constructor (no DI framework, no global state). State transitions are plain functions, unit-testable without a window; the harness for tests that drive the drawn UI is O-114.
- **Threading:**
  - The UI thread runs only `update` and never blocks on I/O or computation.
  - Network, file listing and folder watching run as tasks on the `tokio` runtime. CPU-heavy work (OCR, image decoding and encoding, content hashing) runs only on bounded dedicated thread pools, never on the async runtime:
    - **OCR pool** (default `max(1, min(2, cores / 2))`): per job, decoding of the capture (`CaptureImageLoader`), locate and OCR. ONNX Runtime runs with the `OcrRuntimeSettings` of 07 §2.2, never with its defaults, so OCR uses at most pool size × intra-op threads cores (start value: pool size × 1). The pipeline takes only Captures in state `Ready` (environment set and version classified per R-CAP-3b, 11 §A3) from the persisted queue with at most one prefetch per worker; there is no submit-all into an unbounded queue. Captures in `Imported` (waiting for the first successful `game_versions` fetch, §4a; default, an owner question) and in `EnvironmentPending` are never taken.
    - **Intake pool** (default 1 thread): the stable-file gate's check decode (raster discarded at once), content hashing, colour conversion and upload encoding.
    - **SQLite thread(s):** `rusqlite` calls are blocking and native; they run on a dedicated thread (single writer), not on the async runtime.
  - Peak memory is therefore bounded by (OCR pool size + intake threads) × the per-image peak at the pixel budget, whatever the backlog size.
  - OCR and intake workers run **below normal OS priority**: on Windows `SetThreadPriority` (below normal), on Linux a per-thread nice value (`setpriority` on the thread ID; Linux applies nice per thread). Both calls sit in `adapter-platform` (the only crate with `unsafe`) and are applied by the thread start hook of the pools that `app` creates. Verified in M4 (R-NF-3).
  - **UI updates:** background work never touches view state. It sends its result through a channel and then calls `egui::Context::request_repaint`; `update` drains the channels at its start. Tests drain the same channels directly, without a window.
  - **Dialogs and window state:** all dialogs open through one presenter module in `ui`, and only in answer to a user action. No background event calls a viewport command (focus, minimise, restore, always-on-top, attention request); background events change persistent state only (R-UI-16, 09 §7).
  - All pools and the runtime are created in `app`; the log context is carried by `tracing` spans and re-entered in each task (09 §4).
- **App shell:** a global status area is visible in every view (R-UI-8). It shows:
  - test or production mode and environment (R-SUB-8);
  - connection and reference-data age with the background loading line (R-API-1, R-UI-8, R-UI-13);
  - queue-wide blocks with their action: "queue paused – re-authentication required", "queue paused – app token missing or invalid" (R-SUB-11, R-API-7), "UEX not accepting reports for <environment>" (R-CAP-3a, R-SUB-11) and "queue held – UEX API changed" (R-SUB-11);
  - the UEX staff notification for the report types the app sends (`data_parameters` `notification`), as untrusted plain text cut after 280 characters, in short form here and as a banner in the report editor and manual capture (R-UI-8, O-100);
  - counts of reports and jobs that need action, and the next cooldown ETA (R-SUB-4);
  - game and AI state from M5.

  Everything shown is derived from persisted aggregate and job states, so it survives a restart without a separate notification store. Every state that needs action has exactly one primary location (its queue or session row, or the folder status R-CAP-1e) and is counted in the status area. Nothing in the shell opens a dialog by itself (R-UI-16).
- **Views:**
  1. Input/queue
  2. Session overview (R-UI-14: Draft reports of the current session, "release all ready")
  3. Report editor (table plus screenshot pane with highlight of the source region; opens from queue and session rows)
  4. Manual capture
  5. History (per-row UEX lifecycle status and per-row withdrawal, R-SUB-4)
  6. Settings (folders, environments and UEX mapping, key, game installation and localisation file, test mode, AI, connection hosts, update check, retention, theme, text size; safety thresholds – send and digit threshold, staleness limit, deviation tolerances and `maxObservationAge` – are offered only in the stricter direction, with "Reset to defaults" (R-NF-5); catalogue in §2)
  7. Onboarding wizard; its start screen, shown before any setup step, carries the Star Citizen Fan Kit unit (R-UI-19)
  8. Diagnostics
  9. About dialog (Help menu): legal notices, "Open-source licences" view, source-code link and the Fan Kit unit (R-UI-18, R-UI-19). Its licence list is a resource generated at build time by `xtask` from the licence-gate report (`cargo-deny`) and the reviewed list ([10](10-supply-chain-security.md) S-34); where it is packaged is decided in M1.
- **Fan Kit unit** (R-UI-19): one component renders the logo and both notices. The notice texts come from fixed keys of the base message catalogue (the base locale file; its format is chosen in M0), the logo from the bundled file checked by SHA-256. The theme may set the notices' colour and size within the R-UI-19 limits but applies no effect, tint or opacity to the logo; the image is painted untinted.
- **Theming:** the Tallyline egui theme (dark, light and high contrast, R-UI-17) built from the design tokens (ADR-0005 D6). On Windows the high-contrast theme follows the system setting (`Windows.SPI.HighContrast`, read and watched for changes by `adapter-platform`) while the theme setting is "Follow OS" or has never been changed; an explicitly chosen Dark or Light theme wins, and an explicitly chosen High contrast stays on (decided 2026-10-09). On Linux the user chooses it. Beyond that, "Follow OS" follows only the system's light or dark colour scheme (D8, ADR-0004). The colours for recognition confidence and deviation are theme tokens (palette suitable for colour vision deficiency, replaceable in the theme).
- **Rendering load** (R-NF-3): no continuous repaint. The UI repaints on input, on a channel result (`request_repaint`) and, for timer-driven labels, with `request_repaint_after` at most once per second; while the window is minimised no timer-driven repaint is requested. There are no continuous animations and no indeterminate progress indicators. GPU and VRAM load of the wgpu backend next to the game are measured in M4 (O-113).
- **Field marking** (R-UI-4, R-UI-10..12):
  - `reporting` builds each `Field` from a `FieldReading` (origin `Recognized`) or from user input (origin `User`) and computes its `FieldAssessment` (`confidence`, `level`, `deviation`, `reference_outdated`, `reference`, `reference_age`, `delta`) with `DeviationAssessor`. The function is pure and property-tested; `level` follows the rule in 07 §2.6, `referenceOutdated` the stale-reference rule there.
  - Whether a field currently blocks release under I2 is computed once in `reporting` (e.g. `SubmissionGate::blocking_fields`), never in the view state; it also drives F8 navigation and the R-UI-12 counters.
  - The view state maps `Field` (assessment, confirmation, origin) 1:1 to **field states**, without thresholds or findings logic. The Tallyline `TableCell` widget takes the field states and paints the confidence channel as border plus icon and the deviation channel as background plus Δ badge. The names below are the state names of the design system (earlier documents wrote them with a leading colon, as CSS pseudo-classes); in code they are enum variants:
    - confidence channel (icon and border): `confidence-confirm`, `confidence-select`, `confidence-correct` (level OK has none), `user-entered`, `confirmed`, `double-confirmed` (OCR and AI agree, 07 §2.7), `confirmation-suspended` (I7);
    - deviation channel (background and Δ badge): `deviation-minor`, `deviation-major`, `no-reference`, `reference-outdated`, `deviation-worsened` (I6);
    - other field states: `ai-hint` (a differing AI reading that never overwrites, 07 §2.7), `not-sent` (an optional value that failed its checks, 11 §A1 "Mandatory field");
    - gate state: `needs-confirmation` = the field or its row needs a user decision before release: the I2 cases (level other than OK and not resolved by confirmation or correction, or an unconfirmed `MAJOR` deviation), a confirmation revoked by a worsened deviation (I6), a confirmation suspended by a conflicting reading (I7), an unexpected commodity (R-UI-12) and a row flagged `NewerObservationSent` (R-VAL-8). All of them already block release; the field state shows them alike (decided 2026-10-09 by @greluc, checkpoint B of the earlier JavaFX handoff);
    - row level: `unreviewed` (11 §A1), `newer-observation-sent` (R-VAL-8), `row-selected` (set from the review table's own selection state, because the table works in cell selection and does not mark the selected row by itself; ADR-0004, SP-9).
  - All other states (report, job, capture, folder, game, AI, connection, account, UEX row lifecycle, withdrawal, mode) are state identifiers `tl-state-<id>` rendered by the Tallyline widgets ([docs/design-system/states.md](../design-system/states.md)).
  - The view contains no comparison logic; this guarantees the same assessment in OCR and manual capture.

## 8. Platform integration

| Topic | Windows | Linux |
|---|---|---|
| Secret store | Credential Manager, through the `keyring` crate (4.2.0) or, if it cannot meet R-NF-4, through the `windows` crate in `adapter-platform`; chosen in M0 | Secret Service through the same `keyring` crate or a D-Bus client chosen in M0; fallback file per R-NF-4 (0600 from creation, refused if wider; not on file systems without POSIX permissions) |
| Certificate store | rustls with `rustls-platform-verifier` and the `aws-lc-rs` provider (ADR-0006, O-110) hands chain building and trust decisions to the Windows certificate store; it checks the revocation of the end certificate, which lets Windows contact CA hosts (O-126, §9 N9) | the same verifier reads the roots once at start through `rustls-native-certs`: `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR` when set, otherwise the locations `openssl-probe` knows (among them `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`, `/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt`, `/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem`, `/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem` and `/etc/ssl/cert.pem`); verification by `rustls-webpki`, no revocation checking (read at source 2026-10-14; the behaviour on the CI image is confirmed by the first test run) |
| Certificate verification | One reviewed verifier configuration shared by `adapter-uex` and `adapter-vlm`; hostname verification stays active; test against a wrong-host certificate | same |
| Proxy | `reqwest` follows the proxy settings it supports on Windows (verified in M0); exception: the Ollama client disables proxying for loopback hosts (confirmed non-loopback Ollama hosts follow the system proxy like UEX) | the proxy environment variables (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`) as far as `reqwest` supports them; whether desktop proxy settings are read is verified in M0 and a gap recorded in 09, with the same Ollama exception |
| Native libraries | The native parts are the registered exceptions of ADR-0005 D2 (09 §3b). **ONNX Runtime:** the shared library (`onnxruntime.dll`) ships next to the executable, pinned by SHA-256 like the OCR assets (10 S-22); the application loads it at run time (`ort` with `load-dynamic`; no build step downloads or links it): it hashes the file and passes its absolute path to `ort::init_from` before any other ONNX Runtime call, after restricting the DLL search path (decided by the M0 link-mode spike on 2026-10-14, O-108; 10 §2.5). The library is the official Microsoft 1.28.3 build. Only the win-x64 and linux-x64 builds ship; `onnxruntime_providers_shared.dll` is not needed for the CPU execution provider and is not shipped. ORT telemetry is switched off per R-NF-12: the application sets `ORT_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` itself (process start row) and disables non-essential events through the `ort` environment setting, if the binding exposes it (verified in M0). On Windows, `onnxruntime.dll` imports `MSVCP140_1.dll` and `VCRUNTIME140_1.dll`; an M0 test loads ORT on a clean Windows machine without the Visual C++ redistributable, and its result decides whether these DLLs must ship (licence question O-12, now limited to them). **SQLite** is compiled into the executable (`rusqlite` with bundled SQLite). Our own binary links the C runtime statically where the toolchain allows it. Nothing is extracted into the shared temp directory; the packaged-app smoke test ([04](04-roadmap.md) M1) checks this. | **ONNX Runtime:** `libonnxruntime.so.1.28.3` (the real file under its versioned name) shipped next to the executable, pinned and loaded as on Windows, without the search-path step; ORT telemetry as on Windows (the Linux telemetry traffic is row X1 of §9). **SQLite** compiled into the executable. Nothing is extracted into the shared temp directory. |
| Process start | No launcher and no runtime options: the executable is its own launcher, so there is no heap or direct-memory flag; memory is bounded by the pixel budget and the pool bounds of §7 (R-NF-3). Before the first ONNX Runtime call, `adapter-platform` sets `ORT_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` in the process environment (R-NF-12); in the 2024 edition that call is `unsafe`, confined to `adapter-platform` and registered in 09 §3a. The M0 network spike still verifies that no ORT traffic remains | same |
| Config file (`ConfigFile`, R-NF-5) | `%APPDATA%\<App>` | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/<app>` (default `~/.config`) |
| Data: **one** SQLite database with all domain tables (queue, history, cooldown, processed-file register, outbox, AI queue) **and** the rebuildable `ref_*` tables; working copies (R-CAP-7); `backup/` (R-NF-11). Never in a cache directory. | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\<App>\data` | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/<app>` (default `~/.local/share`) |
| Logs and diagnostics exports (R-NF-6) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\<App>\logs` | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/<app>/logs` (default `~/.local/state`) |
| Regenerable files only (for example render or shader caches, if the graphics backend writes any); deleting them is harmless | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\<App>\cache` | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/<app>` (default `~/.cache`) |
| Portable mode (R-NF-2) | all of the above under `<executable dir>\data\{config,data,logs,cache}`; if it is not writable, the startup self-test fails visibly (R-NF-5) | same under `<executable dir>/data/` |
| Single instance (R-NF-10) | lock file in the data directory plus a per-user lock `%LOCALAPPDATA%\<App>\instance.lock`, taken in portable mode too; Unix-domain socket in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\<App>\run` | lock file in the data directory plus `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/<app>.lock` (fallback `$XDG_STATE_HOME/<app>`); Unix-domain socket in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (otherwise in an owner-only `run` directory next to the per-user lock file, i.e. `$XDG_STATE_HOME/<app>/run`; never in the cache directory, which moves in portable mode) |
| SC detection | RSI Launcher log, process, drive default paths | Wine/Proton prefixes (configurable; default candidates see assumption A3); process via `/proc` |
| Package | MSI (`cargo-packager` with a pre-installed WiX 3.11.2 pinned by SHA-256 in `docs/dependency-pins.md`, ADR-0005 D7; no NSIS, no licence dialog that adds terms) and a plain ZIP built by `xtask` next to it; every package carries `LICENSE`, `NOTICE` and the notices directory (R-DOC-3) | `.deb` (`cargo-packager`; its `copyright` file is a DEP-5 file, R-DOC-3; verified in the M1 spike, O-116), `tar.gz` built by `xtask` |

The storage rows (config file to single instance) are the single source of truth for storage locations; R-NF-2, R-NF-5, R-NF-9 and R-NF-10 refer to them.

The installed app writes nothing into its installation directory – no config, logs, database, caches or extracted native libraries – so that uninstalling leaves nothing behind and a read-only installation works. All state goes to the storage locations above. The only exception is portable mode (R-NF-2: the archive distributions with `portable.marker`). If the data directories fail the startup self-test (R-NF-5), the app reports it and never falls back to the installation directory.

## 9. Security and privacy

- Secret key only in the OS keystore (Linux fallback file per R-NF-4); masking in logs via a `tracing` layer. A test ensures that the key never appears in a log line.
- Crops: the upload screenshot contains only the shop crop(s) plus the location field. No stored or transmitted crop contains the terminal header with the balance; the exclusion is geometric and happens before the working copy is stored (R-SUB-7, R-CAP-7, F30).
- No telemetry, analytics, crash reporting or remote logging (R-NF-12). The app sends and stores user data only as listed in the data-flow inventory at the end of this section (privacy gate, CLAUDE.md). A local Ollama can forward cloud models to ollama.com; such remote models are used only after consent (R-VLM-6).
- No listening TCP or UDP sockets; the only local IPC is the single-instance Unix-domain socket, which accepts nothing but a fixed activation token (R-NF-10).
- No access to the game process except reading the process list (path and game detection).
- Only the redacted working copies are passed to the VLM, never the whole screenshot (R-VLM-9).
- **Untrusted input** (image files, folders, UEX and Ollama responses):
  - Poison-file guard (R-CAP-1d): before the first decode, `StableFileGate` writes a register row in state `decoding` (path, size, mtime). Success sets it to `imported`, a decode error to `failed`. At startup, a row still in `decoding` becomes `failed` ("decoder crashed") and is decoded again only via "Re-import". Decoding runs on the bounded intake pool (§7), not on the watcher's async task.
  - Header check before decoding (`adapter-files`): dimensions are read from the header with the decoder crate's header-only API, without decoding pixels. Hard upper limits on file size, declared pixel count and embedded ICC profile size live in a settings record (start values 200 MB and 100 MP, far above the R-OCR-17 pixel budget; the profile limit is set in M2 from the decode fixtures). A file above a limit is set aside with a reason, never decoded or downscaled.
  - Folder scan: `FolderScanner` walks the tree without following links. A failed directory or file entry is recorded per folder (R-CAP-1e) and the walk continues. Symbolic links are not followed. On Windows, directory junctions and other reparse points are skipped and reported as "link skipped" (detection method verified in M3). A configured root that is itself a link is resolved once to its canonical path (Wine prefixes are often reached through symlinks), and every candidate's real path must lie under the root's real path.
  - Responses: `adapter-uex` and `adapter-vlm` cap response bodies at a size limit (setting), and the anti-corruption layer range-checks numeric values (R-API-5). `Retry-After` is clamped to a maximum backoff (§6).
  - Tests: decode fixtures in 07 §4 (item 7), and a test that a `decoding` row left over at startup becomes `failed` and is not decoded again.

### Data-flow inventory

The privacy gate ([CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md), R-NF-12) allows user data to leave the machine, or to be stored, only as listed here. A new destination, a new kind of data sent to an existing one, or a dependency that opens network connections of its own needs the project owner's prior approval and updates this inventory in the same pull request. Links that the user clicks (About dialog, user guide, release page) open in the system browser; the app itself sends nothing with them.

**Network**

| # | Destination | Data sent | When | Control | Ref. |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | UEX API, base host (`https` only) | the `secret-key` header and the user's app token as `Authorization: Bearer` (A2, O-85); `User-Agent` and `X-Client-Version` with the app version (R-API-7, O-86); reference-data requests; reports with the redacted upload crops, the observation time as `date_added` (O-91) and, only when the user entered it, `faction_affinity` (R-SUB-13); `data_info` (lifecycle polling, filtered by the user's UEX username), `data_remove`, `/user`. **Received and discarded:** `/user` also returns the user's e-mail address and Discord name; the anti-corruption layer drops them at once, and they are never stored, logged or exported (O-97) | reference refresh, key and token check, send attempts, status polling (at most every 5 min while rows are not final), withdrawal | the user's key; test mode (R-SUB-8) | R-API-1…7, R-SUB-1…13 |
| N2 | UEX mirror host from the built-in list | as N1 | only for failures that provably were not processed (R-SUB-9); the list stays empty until 06 open point 4 confirms the mirror | built-in list | R-API-3 |
| N3 | custom UEX host (expert setting) | as N1, including the secret key | only after explicit confirmation | setting | R-API-3 |
| N4 | GitHub Releases API | the request only (User-Agent with app name and version) | at most once a day | can be disabled | R-NF-7, 10 S-25 |
| N5 | Ollama on a loopback host | redacted panel crops, prompt, model-management calls | AI jobs, model management | AI mode, Off by default | R-VLM-1, R-VLM-6, R-VLM-9 |
| N6 | Ollama registry, contacted by Ollama, not by the app | Ollama's pull request | only when the user starts a pull | user action | R-VLM-7 |
| N7 | non-loopback Ollama host, remote (cloud) models | redacted panel crops (unencrypted over `http`) | only after the R-VLM-6 confirmation | consent per host and model | R-VLM-6, R-VLM-9 |
| N8 | fixed URLs of optional OCR model downloads (later) | the request only | user-initiated download | fixed URL and SHA-256 | R-L10N-3, 10 S-23 |
| N9 | OCSP and CRL endpoints of the CAs that issued the certificates of the UEX hosts, contacted by the Windows certificate chain engine when `rustls-platform-verifier` verifies a server certificate (Windows only; Linux does no revocation checking) | the revocation request for the server's certificate, made by Windows, not by our code; no data of ours | during a TLS handshake when Windows holds no fresh cached revocation answer; 10 second timeout | accepted by @greluc on 2026-10-14 (O-126); no setting | ADR-0006, 10 S-26 |
| X1 | **Known exception until mitigated:** telemetry of ONNX Runtime's official natives | Linux: trace events over HTTPS from the 1DS SDK, with a persistent device identifier (the endpoint `mobile.events.data.microsoft.com` is in the 1.30.0 native); Windows: ETW TraceLogging events, which Windows may forward to Microsoft depending on the user's diagnostic-data consent | on by default in the official builds (`Privacy.md` shipped with the official builds) | R-NF-12: our own code sets `ORT_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` before the first ORT call (Linux; ADR-0005 consequences) and switches off non-essential events through the ONNX Runtime environment setting before the first session, if the `ort` binding exposes it (both platforms), verified by the M0 network spike; if anything remains, an ORT build with `--no_telemetry` (O-13). The row becomes "mitigated" only when the spike and the smoke-test network check pass; no release bundles ONNX Runtime before that. | R-NF-12 |

**Local storage** (locations: §8 storage rows)

| # | Store | Content | Retention | Ref. |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | OS keystore (Linux fallback file per R-NF-4) | secret key, user-provided app token | until changed or "delete all local data" | R-NF-4, R-NF-9 |
| L2 | config file | folders, settings, hosts, consents | until changed or deleted | R-NF-5, R-NF-9 |
| L3 | SQLite database | queue, history with `ids_reports` (each with its `date_added`), per-row UEX lifecycle status and withdrawal results, cooldowns, Game.log witness facts (G1), processed-file register, outbox, AI queue, version and channel history, reference-data cache | history metadata 1 year; register entries per R-CAP-1d; reference data per TTL | R-CAP-1d, R-CAP-7, R-API-1 |
| L4 | working copies (redacted panel crops) and the inbox for images without a source file (§4a) | redacted crops; inbox copies | R-CAP-7; inbox per R-OCR-16 | R-CAP-7, R-OCR-16 |
| L5 | database backups (`backup/`) | database copies and the config file | the last 3 backups | R-NF-11, [release process](../release-process.md) |
| L6 | logs | rotating log files, secrets masked | rotation limits set in M1 | R-NF-6 |
| L7 | diagnostics export | allowlisted files, saved where the user chooses | the user's file | R-NF-6 |
| L8 | cache directory | regenerable files only (for example render or shader caches, if the graphics backend writes any) | can be deleted at any time | §8 |

**Local sources read** (read-only; nothing from them leaves the machine)

| # | Source | What is used | When | Control | Ref. |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | the game's `Game.log` of the capture's channel, and its `build_manifest.id` | witness facts only: kiosk location, buy-side assortment, container sizes per commodity, branch and build version, each with its log time; kept with the scan in L3. The player's handle and player ID, network endpoints, addresses, session IDs and user paths are dropped while parsing and never stored, logged or exported; stock quantities and prices are never used. Never part of the diagnostics export | while the witness is on, for captures of a game version whose line format is validated | opt-in, default off (`GameSettingsStore`) | R-OCR-20, A24 |

## 10. Build and CI

- Cargo workspace (resolver and shared dependency versions in the root `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` committed), stable Rust pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (edition 2024; exact pin set in M0; raised in its own pull requests, ADR-0005 D10). Repository checks and generators are the `xtask` crate (ADR-0005 D12).
- GitHub Actions, matrix `windows-latest` and `ubuntu-latest`:
  - `cargo xtask check`, always with `--locked`: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy` with `-D warnings` (including `disallowed_types` and `disallowed_methods`), all tests, the architecture rules over `cargo metadata`, `cargo-deny` (licences, sources, bans, duplicates), `cargo-audit`, `cargo-vet` and the verification of the vendored sources against their committed hashes (10 S-4, ADR-0005 D8, D13)
  - OCR eval on the public (redacted) corpus
  - on tags: read-only build jobs (`cargo-packager` per OS, archives by `xtask`, SBOM) with the packaged-app smoke test ([04](04-roadmap.md) M1)
- Separate jobs outside `check`: mutation testing with `cargo-mutants` (changed code in the PR, full run nightly, 11 §B3) and the coverage report with `cargo-llvm-cov`; OSV scan (in the PR, daily on `main` and on the latest release tag, 10 S-19); dependency submission (S-20); the weekly live-API drift job (04 M1).
- **Repository and licence gates** from M0 ([10](10-supply-chain-security.md) S-32…S-37, ADR-0003): the licence gate (`cargo-deny`, part of `check`), `reuse lint` and the `LICENSE`/`LICENSES` comparison, the DCO check, the English check, gitleaks, actionlint and zizmor, CodeQL for GitHub Actions, dependency review. CI tools outside Cargo are pinned per S-36.
- Releases: a publish job without a build downloads the build outputs, computes SHA-256 checksums, attests them and publishes them with the CycloneDX SBOM (10 S-14, S-16; generator candidate `cargo-cyclonedx`, chosen in M0), the plain ZIP next to the MSI (R-DOC-3) and the source archives of R-DOC-4. A read-only build job fetches those archives from pinned URLs and checks them against committed SHA-256 values, like the OCR assets (10 S-22).
- **Supply chain:** `Cargo.lock` with `--locked`, `cargo vendor` with committed hashes, `cargo-deny`, `cargo-audit`, `cargo-vet`, SHA-pinned actions – see [10-supply-chain-security.md](10-supply-chain-security.md).
